The following outlines team RE(Solutons)'s solution: FireOn functionalities
## Description
FireOn is a machine learning model web application that detects fires and objects that could be associated with antecedents of fire. The application is built using Tensorflow and Streamlit. The model is builded using a ResNet50 model architecture.
